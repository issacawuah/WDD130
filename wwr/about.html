            <h2>History</h2>
             <p>Rafting as a recreational activity has roots that trace back to the mid-19th century. In the United States, the first commercial rafting trips began on the Snake River in Wyoming in the 1950s. Initially, these trips were rudimentary and often involved makeshift equipment. As interest grew, particularly during the 1960s and 1970s, more formalized operations emerged.As rafting gained popularity, particularly in regions with abundant rivers and scenic landscapes, entrepreneurs began to establish commercial rafting companies. These companies offered guided trips, equipment rentals, and often developed basic infrastructure such as campsites and amenities along popular rafting routes.</p>
